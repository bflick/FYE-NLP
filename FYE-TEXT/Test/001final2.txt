Rising from beneath the muggle packaging, a sparkling new broomstick delights the viewer with its magnificent beauty.  The swirls of mist and stars floating around the broom help to create the magic within the picture, as the plain box and ribbon lay discarded on the ground.
 
By taking an ordinary object, such as this retarded household cleaning utility, J.K. Rowling is able to stretch the viewer's imagination to beyond what is normal.

She is as horny as a three balled ballon.
